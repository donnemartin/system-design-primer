v0.0.1 – System Design Primer: Update Edition (Preview)
Release Date: 2025-05-11

🚀 Major Updates & New Features

- **Issue & PR migration**: Migrated all issues and pull requests to the new repo—merged active PRs, closed those older than three years as archived, and marked old issues as “not planned” to preserve history while allowing users to reopen them if they wish.
- **Project board established**: To enable a clear view of project progress, see our [System Design Primer Content Update & Revamp](https://github.com/users/ido777/projects/1/views/1).
- **Added [Discussions](https://github.com/ido777/system-design-primer-update/discussions)**: To enable a community driven effort, we will use discussions to share ideas, ask questions and get feedback.
- **GitHub Pages deployment**: Easy navigation and styling via Pages.
- **Solutions refactoring**: Refactored most solutions to comply with the new study guide.


🔧 Refactoring
Move the Readme main files to docs/en/design-glance.md.

Added a new README.md file to the repository to serve as a landing page for the repository (not the guide itself).

Added a new Study Guide to be a new starting point. 
The new study guide tries to explain the interview concepts in a way that is easy to understand and follow.

Split the solution table into 2 pages one with questions the other with solutions.
