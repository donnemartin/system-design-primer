##### üåç Translations ‚Äì Temporary Hold

We appreciate the incredible global interest in translating **The System Design Primer** into many languages. However, we‚Äôre currently **undergoing major changes and restructuring the English content**, which means that translations will quickly fall out of sync.

To avoid wasted effort, **we are temporarily pausing all translation work** until:
- The new English content is stabilized  
- We define a more robust and maintainable translation workflow

üì¢ **Want to help shape the future of translations?**  
Please join the discussion [here](https://github.com/ido777/system-design-primer-update/discussions) and share your ideas on how we should approach:
- Maintaining translation accuracy over time  
- Organizing language-specific branches or files  
- Managing community contributions effectively  

Your input is valuable and will help us build a better, more inclusive project. Thank you for your patience and support!
