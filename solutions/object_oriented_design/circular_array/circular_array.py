        In a naive implementation, full and empty are both indicated by read == write, which introduces an
        ambiguity. Thus, to break this, a circular array is assumed to be full if the write pointer is one
        position behind the read pointer. To preserve the inituitiveness of the class interface, the internal
        size property is incremented by 1, a sentinel element (so this way the user won't be surprised that their
        array that supposedly fits 10 elements only accomodates 9).
