# Design a database in UML without using ER diagram
The database can be designed using the Class diagram in UML, instead of the ER diagram.
## Approach
1. Identify the entities involved in the database.
2. Identify the attributes for every entity.
3. Identify the relationships between the entities.
4. For every entity develop a class diagram using UML.
5. The class name should be given as name of the entity identified in first step.
6. The attributes of each class should be taken as the attributes identified for the particular entity in second step.
7. The operations can be left empty for every class, as the entities will not be having any operations in database.
8. These classes can be joined using the association relationship in UML, as per the relationships identified in third step.
