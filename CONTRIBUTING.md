## Pull Requests

The preferred way to contribute is to fork the
[main repository](https://github.com/ido777/system-design-primer-update) on GitHub.

1. Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/ido777/system-design-primer-update).  Click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page.  This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:

        $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/system-design-primer.git
        $ cd system-design-primer

3. Create a branch to hold your changes and start making changes. Don't work in the `master` branch!

        $ git checkout -b my-feature

4. Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version control. When you're done editing, run the following to record your changes in Git:

        $ git add modified_files
        $ git commit

5. Push your changes to GitHub with:

        $ git push -u origin my-feature

6. Finally, go to the web page of your fork of the `system-design-primer` repo and click 'Pull Request' to send your changes for review.

## Translations

Although the original repo included translations many were were never merged and others were not updated for a while.
In addition the english version is now going through a major upgrade so for now let's avoid investing in translations.

### Why?

1) We want to build a better process for translations, with the help of genAI tools and a community process that is easy to maintain.
2) It is not clear if the translations are used by many people or really needed.
