### Learn how to design large-scale systems

Learning how to design scalable systems will help you become a better engineer.

System design is a broad topic. There is a **vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web** on system design principles.

This repo is an **organized collection** of resources to help you learn how to build systems at scale.

### Learn from the open source community

This is a continually updated, open source project.

[Contributions](#contributing) are welcome!

### Prep for the system design interview

In addition to coding interviews, system design is a **required component** of the **technical interview process** at many tech companies.

**Practice common system design interview questions** and **compare** your results with **sample solutions**: discussions, code, and diagrams.

Additional topics for interview prep:

* [Study guide](#study-guide)
* [How to approach a system design interview question](#how-to-approach-a-system-design-interview-question)
* [System design interview questions, **with solutions**](#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions)
* [Object-oriented design interview questions, **with solutions**](#object-oriented-design-interview-questions-with-solutions)
* [Additional system design interview questions](#additional-system-design-interview-questions)

The provided [Anki flashcard decks](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) use spaced repetition to help you retain key system design concepts.

### Available Decks:

* [System design deck](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/tree/master/resources/flash_cards/System%20Design.apkg)
* [System design exercises deck](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/tree/master/resources/flash_cards/System%20Design%20Exercises.apkg)
* [Object oriented design exercises deck](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/tree/master/resources/flash_cards/OO%20Design.apkg)

### How to Use Anki Flashcards:

1. **Download Anki**: Get the free app from [ankiweb.net](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
2. **Import Decks**: Download and import the .apkg files from the links above
3. **Daily Review**: Spend 15-30 minutes daily reviewing cards
4. **Consistency**: The spaced repetition algorithm works best with daily practice
5. **Active Recall**: Try to answer before flipping the card

### Benefits of Spaced Repetition:

- **Long-term Retention**: Information moves to long-term memory
- **Efficient Learning**: Focus on cards you're about to forget
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual metrics of your learning progress
- **Customizable**: Add your own cards for personalized learning
