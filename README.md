### Learn how to design large-scale systems

Learning how to design scalable systems will help you become a better engineer.

System design is a broad topic.  There is a **vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web** on system design principles.

This repo is an **organized collection** of resources to help you learn how to build systems at scale.

### Learn from the open source community

This is a continually updated, open source project.

[Contributions](#contributing) are welcome!

### Prep for the system design interview

In addition to coding interviews, system design is a **required component** of the **technical interview process** at many tech companies.

**Practice common system design interview questions** and **compare** your results with **sample solutions**: discussions, code, and diagrams.

Additional topics for interview prep:
