## System design topics: start here

New to system design?

First, you'll need a basic understanding of common principles, learning about what they are, how they are used, and their pros and cons.

### Step 1: Review the scalability video lecture

* Topics covered:
    * Vertical scaling
    * Horizontal scaling
    * Caching
    * Load balancing
    * Database replication
    * Database partitioning
    * High availability 


### Step 2: Review the scalability article

    * [Clones](https://lecloud.tumblr.com/post/7295452622/scalability-for-dummies-part-1-clones)
    * [Databases](https://lecloud.tumblr.com/post/7994751381/scalability-for-dummies-part-2-database)
    * [Caches](https://lecloud.tumblr.com/post/9246290032/scalability-for-dummies-part-3-cache)
    * [Asynchronism](https://lecloud.tumblr.com/post/9699762917/scalability-for-dummies-part-4-asynchronism)

### Next steps

Next, we'll look at high-level trade-offs:

* **Performance** vs **scalability**
* **Latency** vs **throughput**
* **Availability** vs **consistency**

Keep in mind that **everything is a trade-off**.

Then we'll dive into more specific topics such as DNS, CDNs, and load balancers.
