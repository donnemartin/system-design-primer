# System Design Primer: Update Edition

Welcome to the **System Design Primer: Update Edition**. This project is an evolution of the original [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer), tailored for the era of 2025 & Generative AI.

## Introduction

### 1. Software Development in 2025: Kubernetes & Generative AI

The world of software development has evolved dramatically since 2017. Today, systems are designed for distribution from day one, powered by Kubernetes, container orchestration, and the rise of Generative AI. This shift demands fresh perspectives on architecture, scalability, and operational practices.

### 2. Why We Need an Updated Edition

- **Outdated Core Content**: The majority of the original material dates back to 2017. Foundational chapters on scaling, fault tolerance, and microservices were written before Kubernetes became ubiquitous.
- **Generative AI Impact**: Emerging AI-driven patterns—from inference pipelines to LLM-powered observability—are not covered in the legacy primer. Incorporating these topics will keep the guide relevant.
- **Guide structure**: The structure is not optimal for learning. It is not easy to follow and understand the guide. People were asking for a better structure already from 2021 [here for example](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/pull/598).
- **Stagnant Maintenance**: Even minor fixes—typo corrections, link updates, and broken URL patches—have gone unaddressed for at least two years. Examples include [is this awesome repo no longer been updated?](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/issues/840) that was opened at **Feb 2024** or [Indieflashblog link is dead](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/issues/501) that was opened at **Jan 2021**.

### 3. Community Call to Action

The original repo served countless learners and interview candidates, but its current lack of maintenance makes it effectively obsolete. If you find value in revitalizing this resource:

- ⭐ **Star this fork** so it gains visibility
- 📝 **Contribute fixes** for typos, link repairs, and outdated examples
- 💡 **Submit enhancements** on Kubernetes best practices, AI-powered architectures, and modern tooling

Together, we can create a state-of-the-art primer that reflects the realities of cloud-native, AI-augmented system design in 2025 and beyond.
